## Abstract
The present paper undertakes the progress of the planning and design of a manufacturing process in a collaborative Smart Factory implementation at Tecnologico de Monterrey, campus Monterrey. This document appeals to the Lean Manufacturing technique to demonstrate the process and design of a collaborative production using cyber-physical systems that comply with Industry 4.0. This project intends to replicate the processes applied in a manufacturing factory, helping students to develop new technologies and solutions to real industry problems. The Smart Factory implementation would include Autonomous, Industrial, and Collaborative robots, Computer Vision, IoT, Data Warehouses, Lean Manufacturing, and Six Sigma principles.
