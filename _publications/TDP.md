## Abstract
The present Team Description Paper (TDP) is a compilation of the strategies and resources proposed by the Roborregos team in order to solve the Latin American Robotics Competition Open Challenge of 2019. In the following segments, detailed descriptions and justifications about the electric, technical and mechanical procedures can be found. This, with the objective of painting a clearer picture of how we are preparing ourselves to overcome the diverse obstacles present in these areas, and talk about the different techniques to be applied such as data filtering, on-board processing, computer vision, etc.
