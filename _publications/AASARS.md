## Abstract
Across multiple industries, there has been an increasing necessity for efficiency, reliability and robustness of the manufacturing process in place. This has led to an increment in the interconnected robotic systems present in the industrial plants working in proximity with human peers. New challenges derive from this unfamiliar domain, like ensuring the safety of human-robot interactions in open spaces and generating robots that are capable of adapting to new environments. These challenges lead to a meaningful opportunity to develop engineering competencies in the design and simulation of a Smart Learning Factory (SLF) that solves them. In this paper the results of a group of engineering students working in a Cyber-Physical SLF are presented. This includes the design of the system, robot interactions and task allocations to fulfill the production plan.
