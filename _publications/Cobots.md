## Abstract
Human-Robot collaboration is a key pillar in many industrial and domestic applications, such as collaborative smart factories, Senior care centers, health, etc.  Hence, to increase efficiency and performance, robots have been introduced in human environments, causing stress, anxiety, and rejection. The aim of this work is to develop an interdisciplinary solution to design friendly collaborative robots for a Smart Factory, that will serve as a teaching support technology which enables undergraduate students to work together, learn, and develop important engineering skills that would not be acquired during a traditional classroom lecture.
