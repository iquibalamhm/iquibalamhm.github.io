## Abstract
The present paper undertakes the design, development, and implementation of an autonomous, flexible robotic platform (PiBOT), capable of monitoring the environment, analyzing data and generating metrics in real-time; additionally, the PiBOT can interact with the people around it as a collaborative robot. The 2021 version is focused on the prevention of COVID-19 infections by identifying faults to the preventive measures such as social distancing and the use of face masks. For this, the robot generates physical alerts for compliance. This project intends to make a robotic system capable of patrolling and analyzing human behavior in the context of a university, helping students to develop new technologies and solutions to post-pandemic scenarios. The PiBOT implementation would include Computer Vision, Web Interfaces, Navigation, Augmented Reality, Autonomous and Collaborative Robot Development, and Robotic Suspension Design.
