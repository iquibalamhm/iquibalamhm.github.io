Education
======
* B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, 
                              Graduation Date: June 2022, GPA 98/100.

* La Universidad de la Habana, Cuba, 
                              Study Abroad June 2018, GPA: 5/5.

Work Experience
======
* Research Intern Harvard Medical School
  * Working with Fetal Magnetic Reasonance Imaging developing .
  * Supervisor: Dr. Im Kiho

* Robotics Institute Summer Scholar (RISS) at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, MA, USA)  Python   (May – August 2021) 
  * Interactive Algebra Interface. Develop a platform where students can learn algebra while interacting with mathematical functions using a glove. 
  * The processing is done using OpenCV for filtering and image processing and PyGame for rendering. 
  * To be published in the RISS 2021 Journal. 

* DeAcero, Research and Development Intern, (Monterrey, NL, Mexico),  Python / R,    February – July 2021
  * Develop solutions to have a better performance in a couple of processes. 
  * I developed data acquisition and analysis in real-time using a Raspberry Pi connected 
to a PLC of a galvanized wire production line.
  * I proposed a Six Sigma analysis in R and data processing using some python libraries such as Pandas. 

* On Campus Job, Research Intern (Monterrey, NL, Mexico)   Python   August 2020 – July 2021 
  * We developed an autonomous robot to help secure safe social distance between people on campus focused on the current COVID pande mic. 
  * I developed the computer vision algorithm based on multiple Deep Neural Networks using TensorFlow as a framework; and YoloV4 a nd Res10 as architectures. 

* National Instruments, Engineering Intern (Monterrey, NL, Mexico)  , C / MATLAB /Simulink , February – May 2020 
  * Automotive embedded project to develop the GG-AWES technology based on wind energy generated with an autonomous drone connected to a motor on the  ground.  
  * I  mainly  worked  on  Simulink-MATLAB  simulations  of  the  drone  flight,  developing  a  3-DOF  nonlinear  analysis,  testing  it  with  multiple  possible scenarios, and C code deployment in a MATEK F765 flight computer.   
 
* Qualtia Alimentos, Digital Transformation Intern (Monterrey, NL, Mexico),  C++ ,  January – February 2020 
  * Quality control of meat pieces before and after a process. To track the efficiency and well performance of the process I designed a volume measurement algorithm using a 3D camera. 
  * We developed a useful prototype for future in-plant implementation. 
 
* Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at McMaster University (Hamilton, ON, Canada), C++,    May – August 2019 
  * Collaborative Robot Arm Software Development. Point cloud processing using Point Cloud Library (PCL) and OpenCV to segment a hand for gesture recognition for human-robot interaction. 
  * Trained a Machine Learning model with features from the hand (volume, area, convexity, circularity) achieving more than 90% of precision in the predictions.   

Skills
======
